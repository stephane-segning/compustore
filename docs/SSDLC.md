## B. Threat Modeling

**Overview**  
Threat modeling for Compustore will identify potential security risks across three user roles (anonymous, user, admin) and within key functionalities such as product management, order processing, and payment handling. The model will use the STRIDE framework to classify threats and evaluate them from both the frontend and backend perspectives. Given that the application will deploy on Vercel and use Neon.tech for production databases, considerations around cloud security, API access, and data protection are essential.

### User Roles and Threats

#### 1. **Anonymous User (Unauthenticated Access)**

- **Role Description**: This role represents all users who have not logged into the application. Anonymous users should be able to browse products and view individual product details but will not have access to sensitive data or any order history.
- **Potential Threats**:
  - **Spoofing and Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized access attempts to impersonate a logged-in user, potentially via forged cookies or manipulated session tokens.
  - **Tampering**: Attempts to modify publicly accessible endpoints to retrieve restricted data (e.g., viewing order history or accessing admin pages).
  - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Flooding of public endpoints like product listings to overwhelm server capacity.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Use secure session cookies with HttpOnly and SameSite attributes.
  - Enforce access control by validating user sessions with `useSession` in NextAuth.js to prevent unauthorized access to logged-in user data.
  - Rate-limit anonymous access to public endpoints to prevent DoS attacks.

#### 2. **User (Authenticated Customer)**

- **Role Description**: Authenticated users can browse products, view product details, add products to a cart, and complete purchases. They can also view their own order history but not the order histories of other users.
- **Potential Threats**:
  - **Elevation of Privileges**: Attempt to escalate privileges by tampering with session tokens or manipulating API requests to gain access to admin-level features.
  - **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized access to other users’ order data or sensitive payment information.
  - **Repudiation**: Users may dispute transactions or claim lack of accountability for certain actions (e.g., unauthorized purchases).
- **Mitigations**:
  - Implement role-based access controls to restrict order history views to the authenticated user’s own records only.
  - Validate all session tokens with NextAuth.js to prevent token tampering or reuse attacks.
  - Implement logging and monitoring to track user activities, which aids in auditing and repudiation handling.

#### 3. **Admin (Authorized Administrator)**

- **Role Description**: Admins have full access to product and order management, including creating, updating, and deleting products. They can also capture orders and manage the order lifecycle.
- **Potential Threats**:
  - **Elevation of Privileges**: Unauthorized users gaining admin privileges, possibly through unpatched security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
  - **Information Disclosure**: Accidental exposure of sensitive data, such as product costs, order data, or customer PII, due to admin actions.
  - **Tampering and Repudiation**: Malicious or accidental modifications of order and product records without proper accountability.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for admin users to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Enforce strict logging of admin actions for accountability and auditing.
  - Implement role-based access restrictions, ensuring CRUD operations are only accessible to authenticated admin roles.
  - Review and apply the principle of least privilege, ensuring admin accounts are created only as necessary and periodically reviewed.

### Component-Based Threats

#### 1. **Product and Order Management**

- **Threats**:
  - **Tampering**: Unauthorized changes to product data or order statuses via unsecured endpoints.
  - **Information Disclosure**: Exposing product or order data inadvertently through poorly secured API endpoints.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Secure CRUD endpoints with role-based access control, allowing only authenticated admin users to perform modifications.
  - Sanitize and validate all data inputs and outputs to prevent injection attacks.

#### 2. **Payment Processing and Stripe Integration**

- **Threats**:
  - **Spoofing**: Attempting to impersonate payment requests or responses between the application and Stripe.
  - **Tampering**: Modifying payment data in transit to exploit the system, such as changing payment amounts or intercepting invoice data.
  - **Information Disclosure**: Exposure of sensitive payment data or customer billing information.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Use HTTPS for all transactions and secure webhooks to prevent data tampering and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - Only store minimal payment details and rely on Stripe to manage sensitive payment information directly.
  - Implement webhook verification with Stripe to ensure authenticity of incoming payment notifications.

#### 3. **Authentication and Session Management**

- **Threats**:
  - **Session Hijacking**: Stealing or forging session cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
  - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Exploiting the user's logged-in state to perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.
  - **Repudiation**: Users potentially denying specific actions or purchases made within their session.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Use secure session cookies with HttpOnly and SameSite attributes to prevent session hijacking.
  - Implement CSRF protection, especially on sensitive actions like account updates and order placements.
  - Log all significant user actions to provide an audit trail for tracking user activity and mitigating repudiation.

#### 4. **Deployment and Data Storage (Vercel and Neon.tech)**

- **Threats**:
  - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overloading the production server or database, leading to downtime or performance issues.
  - **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access to the database, potentially exposing user data and order information.
- **Mitigations**:
  - Use Vercel’s security features and Neon.tech’s built-in security configurations, including access control and network restrictions, to protect against unauthorized access.
  - Enable automated backups in Neon.tech and implement secure database credentials management via Vercel’s environment variables.
  - Monitor server and database access logs and set up alerts for unusual access patterns or potential DoS attacks.
